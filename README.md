## Hi there 👋 I'm Vaishnavi!

🎓 I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** at *Syracuse University*.  
💻 I love building things that combine creativity and technology — from **iOS apps** to **machine learning projects**.

---

### 🌼 About Me
I’m curious about how technology can make everyday life easier and more meaningful.  
Most of my projects revolve around building apps or models that solve real problems — like my iOS app *Sight*, which helps visually impaired users recognize objects and text in real time.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **painting**, exploring new ideas, or learning something that sparks creativity. 🎨  
I believe art and tech share the same heart — both are about creating something that connects with people. ✨

### 🛠️ What I Work With
**Languages:** Swift, Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL  
**Frameworks & Tools:** Xcode, ReactJS, Node.js, Flask, Spring Boot  
**Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
**Cloud & Tools:** AWS, Docker, Tableau, Git, Postman

### 🚀 Projects I’ve Worked On
- 🧠 **Sight – iOS App for Visual Impairment Assistance**  
  Built using *Swift*, *Go*, and *Google Vision API* to help users recognize faces, text, and objects.  

- 💧 **Groundwater Quality Prediction Framework**  
  Used *Machine Learning (XGBoost, Scikit-learn)* to predict and classify water quality with 96% accuracy.
